# JavaProject
Elitejersey is a Java Swing-based desktop application that simulates a basic product management or e-commerce system. Designed for educational purposes, it features modules like admin login, product addition, user account handling, and address management.
The application uses object-oriented principles and a modular structure, making it beginner-friendly and easy to understand. It’s built entirely with core Java and Swing, requiring no external libraries.
Users can run the project by compiling Start.java. The GUI is fully functional and organized into multiple classes such as AdminHome, AddProduct, and AccountDetails.
